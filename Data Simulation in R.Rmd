## Directions

The objective of this assignment is to introduce you to  R and R markdown and to complete some basic data simulation exercises.

Please include all code needed to perform the tasks.  This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

To submit this homework you will create the document in Rstudio, using the knitr package (button included in Rstudio) and then submit the document to your [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/) account.  Once uploaded you will submit the link to that document on Canvas. Please make sure that this link is hyperlinked and that I can see the visualization and the code required to create it.

## Questions

1. Simulate data for 30 draws from a normal distribution where the means and standard deviations vary among three distributions.

```{r uniform distribution-3 distributions, echo=TRUE}
# place the code to simulate the data here
set.seed(1)
rnorm(30, mean = c(0,5,10), sd = c(1,5,10))

```

2. Simulate 2 continuous variables (normal distribution) (n=20) and plot the relationship between them

```{r 2 variable plot, echo=TRUE}
# place the code to simulate the data here
set.seed(1)
x = rnorm(20, mean = 0, sd = 1)
set.seed(2)
y = rnorm(20, mean = 0, sd = 1)
plot(y ~ x)
```

3. Simulate 3 variables (x1, x2 and y).  x1 and x2 should be drawn from a uniform distribution and y should be drawn from a normal distribution. Fit a multiple linear regression.

```{r}
# place the code to simulate the data here
set.seed(1)
y = rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
x1 = runif(100, min = 5, max = 10)
x2 = runif(100, min = 100, max = 200)
model1 <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)
plot(model1, which = c(1,1))
summary(model1)
```

4. Simulate 3 letters repeating each letter twice, 2 times.

```{r}
# place the code to simulate the data here
rep(letters[1:3], each = 2, times = 2)
```

5. Create a list of 6 datasets (n = 30) each with 3 groups, 2 factors and two quantitative response variables. Use the replicate function.

````{r}
# place the code to simulate the data here
data1=replicate(n=6, expr = data.frame(
  group = rep(letters[1:3],each=10),
  factor = rep(LETTERS[1:2],length.out=30),
  response1 = rnorm(30, mean =0, sd=1),
  response2 = rnorm(30, mean = 2, sd =5)),
  simplify = FALSE)
str(data1)
```
